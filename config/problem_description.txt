I gave you a list of ticket and I need you to give me that list back, laying out who is the ticket requester, ticket number, and date. 

But your crucial task is to tell me if the ticket was escalated or not. If so, to who? 

It will usually be escalated to a team called "Alpha Academics", which has many sub-teams - Academics Reading, Math, Science. You need to specify the sub-teams, unless you can't find any.  

It can also be escalated  to two specific persons, those will be done via side-conversation (SC, an email). These two specific persons are usually Thiago de Sa, or Guilherme Colombo (Gui).
